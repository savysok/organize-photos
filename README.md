#Bash photo organizer

This is a simple bash script to sort your pictures into folders, based on their exim date data. It will put all jpeg images in their respected folders and any RAW images (CR2 format) into a RAW subfolder.

I use this script to sort my Canon 450D camera photos from the SD Card.

Requires exiftools and zenity to work.
