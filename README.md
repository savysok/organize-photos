#Bash photo organizer

This is a simple bash script to sort your pictures into folders, based on their exim date data.

The folder format is YYYYMMDD (example: 20160214).

The script will put all jpeg images in their respected folders and any RAW images (CR2 format) into a RAW subfolder.

I use this script to sort my Canon 450D camera photos from the SD Card.

#Requirements:

Requires exiftools and zenity to work.
